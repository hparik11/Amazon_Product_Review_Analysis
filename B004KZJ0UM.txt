R2RFQE12EZHZ1X->I was pleasantly surprised to see how well this computer runs with being a refurbished item. It runs like a brand new computer! Easy to navigate and user friendly.

R2HVMQEIQKT2OL->Good laptop. Does everything it's suppose to. However the battery life is absolutely  horrible.I have to charge the laptop like twice a day. I like this laptop but just wished the battery would last longer. It also runs Windows XP, which is not a big deal for me.

R21WUHNSV7PF22->works very well
RS41OAHKXVMEU->I've gotten to be a fan of these laptops, which I've bought from several vendors.  One was fine for months, then began reporting itself as &#34;Not Genuine Windows.&#34;  The others are fine.  I converted the ungenuine one to Ubuntu, and it works fine again.  Apart from the OS issue, they are excellent choices, with relatively modern processors.  Upgrade them with a solid-state disk drive and you have a very good laptop.  Unlike many newer laptops, they have both a serial port and an external VGA display output, both of which are useful.  I suggest you inspect them for a certificate of authenticity for whatever  OS they have installed and run Windows Update on it right away to make sure it'll be OK.  The &#34;Genuine&#34; one has now upgraded to Windows 10, and it made it fine.
R16CLP8YYUF97B->Very good
R27XCTL4O42HF3->I really wanted this to work but the screen is dead. High marks for Amazon return process.

R1YF8RSXIY4NA2->It works well for a XP system, lots of ports, some not useful anymore, 4 usb. Get operating system will not support this program messages.
R3REXCTH6FI4SB->I purchased this for my grandson, he is handicapped and I didn't want to spend a lot of money at first, but this went beyond my expectations, he loves it so much and I still cant believe how much I paid for it,  once again I am amazed at how good everything is I order.  thank you so much

RKTXKKJ9FXGRW->piece of junk to slow
R2YP6WLBGUERD8->I a very happy with my computer.  It is a little slow, but it is only 2G.  I am able to do everything I need on the internet.  Love it.
R3CWO2FBJZHZI8->My older laptop was dying and I was looking to get a new one. Intel's next generation CPU Skylake is just around the corner as well as DDR4 memory. With technology, there is always something better around the corner, but these 2 are a major advancement. So I decided to get an inexpensive older computer to use for the time being. I use it for internet, Quickbooks (my financials), and other light use. So it fits my current needs perfectly. I will probably sell it in the future for a few bucks for someone who just needs a computer for light use. The computer is fast enough for my current needs. If you intend on playing video games or do heavy processing (photoshop), this is probably not the laptop for you (it is not meant to do that). I would have given it 5 stars if it had a built in camera, which unfortunately it doesn't.
R2A76YZTG1U8IW->My daughter saved up for it and she loves it.
RX1TLD4W9E4CP->This was a very good purchase. Thank you.

R2Q4NHMS3UJOU5->Very good product
R306DQ2MPQSZNC->The laptop was in great condition and has given me no issues itself. The charger on the other hand quite working within the first 4 days of using it. I narrowed it down to one of the two cords that was sent to me. It seems that a replacement is proving to be quite a task to track down.
R35A5CTX00Q91D->works perfectly and is exactly what i wanted. For an older computer it works great. Excellent for the price.

R3EYJXI8CYRG7K->I would order from them again!The package arrived as promised and the items were as described.  I was able to boot the system with no problems and the OS and applications worked just fine.
R1SGQ5W9EURUQW->It does what I need it to do. It has a working disc drive. I wish it had Microsoft Word but hey, whatever, it has Openoffice. I'll get used to it. I don't need the newest, zippiest model. This computer does just fine for internet shopping, research, making worksheets, etc.
REH7NKSA6OBHT->Its in great shape and works great as well. Its a no brainer if your looking for a good laptop cheap.
RMJH4F4J8RZF0->good computer kinda slow though
R3DDK9JFPE63YP->Works ok.  Paid for &#34;refurbished&#34;, got keyboard with worn off letters, cracked and chipped case and overall grime on case and screen.  Guess the downloaded porn that came with it was a freebie.
R218AKEEUKY9OW->gracias...
R2QM3P1JHJ94XX->Beautiful notebook PC. I use it mainly to stream movies and browse the net and so far, it still runs smoothly. No heavy processes will touch this notebook, as I shall preserve and extend this little guy's life span.

R33IHZJNDNJTRK->Great machine, easily able to be upgraded to Windows 7.  The gentlemen at JSW were extremely helpful.  When I received this product, the DVD player/burner was not working (it happens when you are shipping sensitive electronic equipment).  But one email later, and after a small review of what the issue was...they replaced the DVD player/burner with no further delay or questions.  The DVD player/burner for this model is easily removable with the touch of a button, it pulls right out and the new one they sent me plugged right in and worked perfectly.
R2K241OGY4QK4W->Microsoft said operating system was not genuine and a lot of there stuff, updates etc, will not work. Plus battery was stone dead. Had to go back to my older pc. Needed to register it but have no number.
R3Q2N3327KIPRL->Received the package on time with no problems works great
RVTYUA8MS3G1V->Came quickly. It does have a bad spot on the screen like it had a magnet close to.
